No tracking.  
No backend servers.

## What is a Promptlet?

A **promptlet** is a small, reusable AI prompt with optional parameters (model, temperature, token limits).

With Prompt It, you can:
- Right-click any selected text on a webpage
- Choose a promptlet from the context menu
- View the result instantly in a side panel
- Chain additional promptlets on the output

Promptlets can be built-in or fully custom.
