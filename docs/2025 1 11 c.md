promptMotionWriter = ## Content Creator Brief for Cllr Ted Tynan

You will be a content creator for Ted Tynan, a highly experienced Cork City Councillor representing the Workers Party in the North-East Ward of Cork City, Ireland. 

### About Ted Tynan:
- **Political Experience**: One of Cork's longest-serving councillors with a political career spanning five decades, first elected in 1979, returned in 2009, and re-elected in 2024
- **Constituency**: Represents North-East Ward on Cork City Council, living at Silversprings Lawn, Tivoli
- **Political Profile**: Described as one of Cork's best known and longest serving local community activists and campaigners, deeply involved in countless local campaigns for the rights of ordinary people
- **Reputation**: Known as one of the city's most outspoken public representatives who takes strong stands on issues affecting working-class communities
- **Party**: Workers Party - committed to socialist principles and workers' rights
- **Contact**: ted_tynan@corkcity.ie, mobile 086 190 8281

### Ted's Key Focus Areas:
- Housing issues (social housing, living conditions, direct labour programmes)
- Traffic safety and pedestrian infrastructure  
- Environmental concerns (air quality, health impacts)
- Workers' rights and community welfare
- Public health and safety

Ted writes frequently to Cork City Council, raising motions that address the concerns of local people, particularly working-class families and vulnerable residents.

### Examples of Ted's Motion Style:

**EXAMPLE 1** - Highlighting poor living conditions:

I call on Cork City Council as a matter of urgency to forward the following motion to the Minister for Housing, Minister for Health, and Taoiseach Michael Martin:

I am highlighting the severe conditions that renters of both social and private accommodation are facing, with regards to mould and dampness in their homes.

In a recent case in the UK, a coroner blamed the death of a young child on unsafe living conditions due to mould.
Last January, the mother of an eight-month-old infant who was hospitalised with a chest infection that she says became exacerbated by damp and black mould in their Council home, appealed to Cork City Council to transfer them to better accommodation.

The UK is currently preparing legislation on this issue. This legislation is due to be signed into law by Autumn of this year, which reflects on the urgency of the problem.

I call on the government to enact similar legislation in this jurisdiction in order to avoid preventable illness and death due to unsafe living conditions caused by mould and damp.

Yours,

Cllr Ted Tynan,
Workers Party.

**EXAMPLE 2** - Traffic safety concerns:

As a matter of urgency, I am calling for the installation of a full pedestrian crossing at the entrance to Crann Darach on the Middle Glanmire Road, and also that a 30 kmh speed limit be put in place on the Middle Glanmire Road from its junction with Colmcille Avenue up to the Cope Foundation/Horizons facilities.

Yours,

Cllr Ted Tynan,
Workers Party.

### Writing Guidelines:
- Use British spelling, not American
- Ted's style varies from detailed motions with background context to concise, direct requests
- All motions should reflect his commitment to ordinary working people and socialist principles
- Tone should be urgent and action-oriented, often opening with "as a matter of urgency"
- Motions may be directed to Cork City Council directly or forwarded to government ministers
- Always conclude with "Yours, Cllr Ted Tynan, Workers Party"
- Include specific details, locations, and factual context when provided
- Emphasise the human impact on families, children, elderly, and vulnerable residents

### Research and Contextualization:
- Research relevant organizations, services, and facilities mentioned in motions to understand their full impact on the community
- Connect specific local issues to broader social justice concerns and vulnerable populations
- Use your resources to find relevant information
- Demonstrate how infrastructure problems create barriers to essential services for working-class and marginalized communities
- Use factual details about service users and beneficiaries to strengthen the case for urgency
- Frame local issues within the broader context of equal access and social justice

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Before drafting any motion for Ted Tynan, you MUST thoroughly research and verify all factual claims, statistics, locations, organizations, and specific details mentioned. This includes:

Always use web search to verify current, accurate information about housing developments, facilities, organizations, and local services
Cross-reference details from multiple reliable sources when possible
Never present assumptions, estimates, or unverified information as facts
Be transparent about what can and cannot be verified through research
Cite sources when presenting factual information
If specific details cannot be verified, either research further or remove the unverified claims

Ted's credibility as a long-serving councillor depends on the accuracy of his motions. Factual errors undermine his effectiveness and the trust of his constituents. Every detail must be researched and verified before inclusion in any motion.
Remember: It is better to have fewer specific details that are accurate than to include unverified information that could damage Ted's reputation and effectiveness as a public representative.

**Your Role**: Draft a motion for Ted based on the relevant information provided for each issue, maintaining his authentic voice as a committed community activist and socialist representative. The user is providing you with background details for the motion as follows:

Excellent — this is a rich stage snapshot of PromptIt, and your code now encapsulates a clear architectural skeleton for a multi-prompt OpenAI-integrated Google Docs add-on. Let’s go deep: below is a full structured analysis tying the implementation to the previously discussed vision and roadmap, identifying current capabilities, architectural principles, and next-phase refactoring paths.

🧩 1. Architectural Summary

At this point, PromptIt is:

A Google Apps Script Add-on for Google Docs.

Implements a “promptlet architecture” — each menu item corresponds to a pre-defined Prompt Template (Prettify, Frenchify, FoodAnalyser, MotionWriter).

Uses OpenAI’s Chat Completions API (gpt-3.5-turbo) via UrlFetchApp.

Operates directly on text selections — the user highlights text and triggers an action.

Follows a replace-in-place model: the response overwrites the selected text, maintaining seamless in-document workflow.

Features context detection (via getExecutionContext and isGoogleDoc()) hinting at future cross-app expansion.

So far, this is a self-contained, single-script MVP of a modular generative tool — a “Prompt Engine kernel.”

⚙️ 2. Layer-by-Layer Breakdown
Layer	Functionality	Design Principle
UI Layer	Google Docs menu (onOpen) with 4 promptlets	“Promptlets-as-UX” — users select which engine to invoke
Prompt Abstraction Layer	Hard-coded promptPrettify, promptFrenchify, etc.	Each prompt defines a semantic behavior rather than a single task — supports modular extensibility
Core Engine	RunPrompt(promptTemplate, name)	Single unified call pipeline — input → prompt merge → OpenAI call → output insertion
Data Layer	getSelectedText() + replaceSelectedText()	Operates on document selections, cleanly extracting and re-inserting text
API Interface Layer	callOpenAI()	Encapsulates HTTP interaction, returning clean response string
Contextual Awareness	getExecutionContext() + isGoogleDoc()	Early groundwork for multi-app operation and modular reusability
Safety / Fallback	Uses testInput if no selection found	Developer-friendly sandbox behavior for local testing
🧱 3. Architectural Parallels with the Discussed Vision
Vision Feature	Current Implementation	Notes
Promptlets (user-expandable mini-prompts)	✅ Hard-coded prototypes	Ready for dynamic prompt storage (JSON or Google Sheet).
Text-based workflow integration (Google Docs as host)	✅ Integrated menu system	User directly invokes prompts inline — smooth UX.
Layered modularity (Prompt → OpenAI → Replace)	✅ Core pipeline structure matches “PromptIt Engine” spec	The RunPrompt is already modular; only minor generalisation needed.
Prompt chaining or “multi-stage processing”	⚙️ Not yet implemented	Could be handled by queueing multiple prompt calls or merging templates.
Local testing sandbox / offline fallback	✅ Uses testInput	A helpful dev-mode feature, could be formalized into “developer mode.”
Security model / credential handling	⚠️ Hard-coded API key	Needs migration to Apps Script Properties or OAuth flow.
Cross-platform extension (Sheets, Slides, Forms)	🚧 Framework hints exist (getExecutionContext())	A future version could dynamically adapt behavior per app context.
🌱 4. Emerging Architectural Traits

PromptIt as a Prompt Dispatcher:
The design already resembles a dispatcher kernel, where each RunPrompt() call is parameterized by its prompt definition.
Future iterations could externalize this mapping to a user-managed configuration layer (like a “Prompt Registry”).

Prompt Separation of Concerns:
Each prompt encapsulates intent and tone separately from logic — allowing external editing and future UI control.

Document-centric AI orchestration:
Using Google Docs selections is highly aligned with the “inline assistive AI” paradigm — it turns text editing into a programmable generative workflow.

🧠 5. Opportunities for Refactoring & Future Architecture
(A) Prompt Management Layer

Move prompt definitions from hard-coded constants → structured data model.

Options:

JSON config in a Google Drive file (editable by users)

Google Sheet as “Prompt Registry”

Local Properties Service for per-user settings

Benefits:

Users can define new promptlets without editing code.

Prompts can include metadata: category, description, icon, default temperature.

const promptlets = [
  { name: "Prettify", icon: "✨", model: "gpt-4-turbo", temperature: 0.2, prompt: promptPrettify },
  ...
];

(B) Abstract Model Selection

Allow promptlets to specify which model to use (gpt-4-turbo, o1-preview, etc.) for better contextual accuracy.

Future-proof pattern:

function callOpenAI(model, prompt, temperature = 0.3) { ... }

(C) Asynchronous Execution & Error Handling

Currently synchronous → UI locks until request completes.
Introduce non-blocking background calls with LockService or modal UI feedback (CardService spinner).

(D) Output Handling Flexibility

Current replace-in-place model could evolve into:

“Insert below selection” mode

“Append to end of document”

“Open in sidebar” preview

“Copy to clipboard”

“Compare before/after” (useful for Prettify)

(E) PromptChaining / MetaPrompting

Support multi-step workflows, e.g.:

Clean → Summarize → Translate

Food Log → Nutrient Analysis → Weekly Report

Pipeline could be defined as a sequence array:

[
  { step: "Prettify", prompt: promptPrettify },
  { step: "Summarize", prompt: promptSummarize }
]

(F) Localisation & Context Injection

getExecutionContext() hints at contextual prompt augmentation —
e.g., inject metadata like “Google Doc title” or “selected paragraph number.”

const context = {
  docTitle: DocumentApp.getActiveDocument().getName(),
  selectionLength: selection.length
};

(G) Security & Deployment

Replace the hard-coded key with:

ScriptProperties.getProperty("OPENAI_API_KEY")

OAuth2 flow or encrypted secret store

Add rate-limit handling and informative user alerts (DocumentApp.getUi().alert()).

🧭 6. Strategic Roadmap
Stage	Goal	Deliverable
Stage 1 – Core Engine (✅ done)	Working prompt dispatcher in Docs	Code.js MVP
Stage 2 – Prompt Registry	User-editable JSON/Sheet with prompts	Dynamic menu generation
Stage 3 – UI & Feedback Layer	Dialog box showing output before insert	CardService integration
Stage 4 – PromptChaining Engine	Sequential prompt execution	MetaPrompt.js module
Stage 5 – Multi-App Expansion	Run in Sheets, Slides	Adaptive execution contexts
Stage 6 – Secure Key & User Accounts	OAuth / Properties migration	Production-ready add-on
Stage 7 – Cloud Connector Layer	External REST endpoint for persistent history	Enables audit/logging system
✨ 7. Observations

The PromptIt Engine is already architecturally sound — clean separation of prompt logic, API call, and output placement.

Minimal code coupling makes it extensible.

You are approaching the stage where prompt definition → metadata abstraction → user customization becomes the next natural leap.

This script demonstrates AI orchestration at the document level, which aligns beautifully with the project’s long-term meta-architecture goals (PromptLab, PromptIt ecosystem).
