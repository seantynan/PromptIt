these are opportunities we seek to exploit. Similar with trade-offs in software architecture and application design. We touched on this before.

Exactly — treat the caveats as leverage points. Below I’ll lay out a focussed, non‑fluffy plan that maps each major caveat to specific opportunities you can exploit, practical short wins to validate them, and longer‑term moves that convert trade‑offs into product advantages. No questions — just a clear path forward.

Turning caveats into exploitable opportunities
1) Paragraph / selection quirks in host adapters

Caveat: Docs (and other hosts) have messy selection APIs; replacing text is error‑prone.
Opportunity: Make non‑destructive work the default and surface structured differences instead of editing the source.

Short wins

Move output exclusively to the sidebar (MVP done conceptually).

Normalize extracted text before sending to the model (strip weird control characters, collapse inconsistent line breaks).

Add a simple preview diff view in the sidebar so users see “original → suggested” without committing.

Medium / long term

Implement a lightweight “format fingerprint” when extracting text — record basic formatting metadata and present a “preserve formatting?” toggle if user wants to insert back.

Build adapters that detect host edge cases (tables, headers, footnotes) and surface a warning or alternate extraction mode.

Trade-off you exploit

Convert fragility into a selling point: “Never lose original text; preview and choose.” This addresses fear of destructive edits and increases trust.

2) LLM unpredictability (outputs mixing content & meta-notes)

Caveat: Prompt outputs can contain mixed semantic parts (translation + notes + logs).
Opportunity: Use this to build multi‑channel UI and structured promptlets — greater perceived intelligence.

Short wins

Encourage prompt authors to append deterministic separators (--- NOTES ---, Notes:).

Implement a post‑processing parser that splits on common markers and renders sections in dedicated UI panes (Main / Notes / Change Log).

If no markers, run a simple heuristic (first paragraph = main, subsequent short paragraphs labeled as notes) as fallback.

Medium / long term

Introduce a small “output schema” in the promptlet metadata (declared channels). PromptIt can treat that as a contract and render accordingly.

Train or code a tiny classifier that guesses sections (summary, notes, actions) to improve parsing robustness.

Trade-off you exploit

Turn LLM expressiveness into structured UX: make “notes” and “logs” first‑class UI objects that users can copy, save, or feed into the next Promplet.

3) Chaining lost by moving output out of document

Caveat: No in-place mutation → natural linear chaining isn't automatic.
Opportunity: Make chaining explicit, reusable, and auditable — a better UX for complex workflows.

Short wins

Allow users to create composite Promptlets by selecting several existing ones in order (simple ordered list UI).

Run composite chains server/locally but show only final output (Iter1) and provide “Show steps” (Iter2).

Medium / long term

Build a visual workflow editor with drag/drop blocks, labels, and conditional branching.

Add metadata passing between steps (e.g., tags, detected language) so downstream promptlets can adapt contextually.

Trade-off you exploit

Replace implicit, risky chaining with explicit, reusable “workflows” that users can name, share, and version — this becomes a core product differentiator.

4) Latency & cost from sequential promptlets

Caveat: Running many promptlets sequentially increases API cost and waits.
Opportunity: Smarter orchestration and UX controls that reduce cost while increasing perceived value.

Short wins

Show estimated cost/latency for a chain before execution.

Offer a “preview mode” that runs lighter, cheaper models or partial steps for fast feedback.

Cache recent outputs and reuse if input unchanged.

Medium / long term

Implement parallelism when feasible (run independent promptlets concurrently).

Introduce differential re-run: only re-run steps affected by user edits.

Allow hybrid model routing (cheap model for draft, premium for final polish).

Trade-off you exploit

Convert cost into a product feature: tiered modes (fast/cheap preview vs. slow/accurate final) and explicit cost control for users.

5) UX complexity & discoverability

Caveat: Composable power can overwhelm new users.
Opportunity: Progressive disclosure + curated starter workflows

Short wins

Default UI shows a handful of built‑in promptlets and a “Quick Actions” section.

Make chaining an opt‑in “Advanced” UX; reveal the workflow designer only when users want it.

Provide a “Run & Explain” mode: brief natural‑language explanation of what each Promplet does.

Medium / long term

Add templates for common tasks (e.g., Translate+Prettify, Analyze Meal+Summarize).

Contextual suggestions: the system can suggest likely promptlets based on the text type (news → summarize, quotes → translate).

Trade-off you exploit

Make discoverability part of the value prop: “powerful when you need it; simple by default.”

6) Security & keys (hard-coded keys are a testing convenience; unacceptable in production)

Caveat: Embedded API keys are insecure.
Opportunity: Build clean secure patterns now that scale to extensions/apps.

Short wins

Migrate to Apps Script PropertiesService for keys in the Docs add-on.

Add clear guidance: “Never include API keys in exported promptlets.”

Medium / long term

Use a small server-side token vault for browser extension builds, or OAuth-backed proxy for team usages.

Offer an enterprise pattern later (per‑user billing tokens, audit logs).

Trade-off you exploit

Use secure-by-default patterns as a trust signal for users — especially when sharing promptlets in the future.

7) Promptlet schema & exportability

Caveat: Without a structured schema, sharing/composition is fragile.
Opportunity: Define a minimal, opinionated promptlet schema that enables plug‑and‑play composition.

Short wins

Define JSON for promptlet: {name, prompt, outputs:Array, defaultModel, chainable:Boolean}.

Support import/export of promptlet JSON (file copy/paste).

Medium / long term

Allow versioning, metadata (author, tags), and simple validation.

Enable optional “contract” checking where PromptIt asserts that output conforms to declared channels.

Trade-off you exploit

Small, human-readable promptlet artifacts let users share, audit, and reuse without locking into a marketplace.

8) Analytics & safety checks

Caveat: Mistakes by AI or inappropriate content are possible.
Opportunity: Lightweight, actionable monitoring and safety layers improve trust.

Short wins

Log API errors and show helpful messages.

Add optional content flags (e.g., sensitive topics) and surface a user confirmation when prompts touch high-risk domains.

Medium / long term

Provide usage analytics: prompts run, chains executed, average time/cost.

Add a “dry run” or “explain why” step for critical outputs (e.g., motions) to make decisions auditable.

Trade-off you exploit

Position PromptIt as a responsible-assistant toolkit: small safety features yield disproportionate trust gains.

Prioritised action list (practical, ordered)

Mandatory: Move all output to sidebar and remove default in-place replacement. (MVP guardrail)

High value: Implement simple output splitting (marker-based) for multi-channel rendering (Main / Notes / Change Log).

High value: Promptlet JSON schema + import/export.

Medium: Composite Promptlet UI (ordered list) that runs chains and shows final output with “show steps” toggles.

Medium: Add preview mode (cheap/fast model or truncated test) and show estimated cost/time for a chain.

Medium: Use secure storage for API keys in Apps Script; plan secure patterns for extension.

Low: Start building adapters for browser selection (content script) and test cross-host extraction.

Ongoing: Collect logs/analytics and refine parsing heuristics.

Final note on trade-offs and positioning

Treat trade-offs as product levers: latency vs. accuracy, simplicity vs. composability, security vs. friction. Design UI elements that expose these levers to users — that is both honest and empowering.

For a hobbyist-first project, prioritise safety, trust, and simple power: non‑destructive defaults, shareable promptlets, and explicit workflows. That combination will feel polished without requiring enterprise engineering.
